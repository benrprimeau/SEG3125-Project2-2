							<h3>Processor</h3>
						</div>
						<p>
							A CPU, sometimes referred to as a computer’s brain, is the workhorse of the machine. 
							It performs the calculations needed by a system, and can vary in speed. The work that a CPU does generates heat, 
							which is why your computer has a fan inside. A more powerful CPU is necessary for intense computer 
							work like editing high-definition video or programming complex software.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="row">
						<div class="mb-2 mt-3">
							<h3>Case</h3>
						</div>
						<p>
							A computer case, also known as a computer chassis, is the enclosure that contains most of the components of a personal computer (usually excluding the display, keyboard, and mouse). Cases are usually constructed from steel (often SECC—steel, electrogalvanized, cold-rolled, coil), aluminium and plastic.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="row">
						<div class="mb-2 mt-3">
							<h3>Operating System</h3>
						</div>
						<p>
							The operating system (OS) manages all of the software and hardware on the computer. 
							It performs basic tasks such as file, memory and process management, handling input and output, and controlling peripheral devices such as disk drives and printers.

							The most common operating system is Microsoft Windows.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="row">
						<div class="mb-2 mt-3">
							<h3>Memory</h3>
						</div>
						<p>
							Memory or RAM is temporary memory of the system. Whenever you open up a Microsoft Word window, 
							your computer places it in RAM, and when you close the window, that RAM is freed. Since RAM is volatile, 
							its contents are lost if the machine loses power. This is why you lose a Word document when the power goes out if you didn’t save it.

							The more RAM you have, the more programs you can run at once. A common cause of slow computers is a lack of sufficient RAM.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="row">
						<div class="mb-2 mt-3">
							<h3>Storage</h3>
						</div>
						<p>
							Since RAM is temporary, your computer needs a place to store data permanently. 
							That’s where the storage comes in. The traditional hard drive consists of several spinning platters with an arm that physically writes data to the disk. 
							However, these drives are slow and are starting to be replaced by the faster solid-state drives.

							Solid-state drives consist of flash memory, like your smartphone or flash drive. They are much faster than traditional hard disk drives, 
							though cost more for the increased efficiency. Both types of drives come in various sizes to suit different needs.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="row">
						<div class="mb-2 mt-3">
							<h3>Graphics</h3>
						</div>
						<p>
							A video card or graphics card is a dedicated unit for handling the output of images to a display. Video cards have their own dedicated RAM for performing these functions. A high-end video card is required to process extremely intense visual functions, such as computer drafting by engineers. Like many components, many types of video cards are available with varying power and prices.

							An alternative to a video card is integrated graphics, which occurs when the system borrows regular RAM for graphics processing. Typically integrated graphics are attached to the CPU, especially on laptops. Integrated graphics is sufficient for normal computing use and is less expensive than a dedicated card, but won’t work for intense editing jobs or high-end games.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="row">
						<div class="mb-2 mt-3">
							<h3>Power Supply</h3>
						</div>
						<p>
							Despite the name, Power Supply Units (PSU) do not supply systems with power - instead they convert it. Specifically, a power supply converts the alternating high voltage current (AC) into direct current (DC), and they also regulate the DC output voltage to the fine tolerances required for modern computing components.
